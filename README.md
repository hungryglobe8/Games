# Games
This repo is a place for me (Casey Rand) to organize my projects and experiment with rebuilding various puzzle games in different languages.
## Minesweeper
The classic game we all know and love (or is it just me?) with a few additional features that increase playability.
* The first click of any game is guaranteed to be a zero. This starts you off with a small region from which to play rather than just one square. Don't waste it on a corner!
* A "reveal all" button appears after all your flags have been expended. A fast way to end the game... one way or the other.
* Stats that prevail across runs showing percentage (TODO: avg time?) and can be reset.
